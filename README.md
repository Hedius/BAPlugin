This modified version of the Battlefield Agency plugin adds a second "Local Whitelist".
This list uses soldier names and EA GUIDs instead of the BA-GUIDs.
By using this list we can fully manage the list over AdKats. (Check E4GLAdKats for a plugin with management support of of this list.)

That's all. Player Joins of whitelisted players are logged to BA but the kick request from the API gets ignored.

License is unknown. Please tell mail me / open an issue or contact me on Discord if I should remove the repo.
Thank you. @BA.
